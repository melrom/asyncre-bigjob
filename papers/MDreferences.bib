                  Molecular Dynamics (FEP/REMD) offers a powerful
                  strategy to improve the convergence of free energy
                  computations. In particular, it has been shown
                  previously that a FEP/REMD scheme allowing random
                  moves within an extended replica ensemble of
                  thermodynamic coupling parameters can improve the
                  statistical convergence in calculations of absolute
                  binding free energy of ligands to proteins
                  [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2009, 5, 2583].  In the
                  present study, FEP/REMD is extended and combined
                  with an accelerated MD simulations method based on
                  Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD (H-REMD) to overcome
                  the additional problems arising from the existence
                  of kinetically trapped conformations within the
                  protein receptor. In the combined strategy, each
                  system with a given thermodynamic coupling factor
                  \lamda in the extended ensemble is further coupled
                  with a set of replicas evolving on a biased energy
                  surface with boosting potentials used to accelerate
                  the interconversion among different rotameric states
                  of the side chains in the neighborhood of the
                  binding site.  Exchanges are allowed to occur
                  alternatively along the axes corresponding to the
                  thermodynamic coupling parameter \lamda and the
                  boosting potential, in an extended dual array of
                  coupled \lamda - and H-REMD simulations.  The method
                  is implemented on the basis of new extensions to the
                  REPDSTR module of the biomolecular simulation
                  program CHARMM. As an illustrative example, the
                  absolute binding free energy of p-xylene to the
                  nonpolar cavity of the L99A mutant of the T4
                  lysozyme was calculated. The tests demonstrate that
                  the dual \lamda-REMD and H-REMD simulation scheme
                  greatly accelerates the configurational sampling of
                  the rotameric states of the side chains around the
                  binding pocket, thereby improving the convergence of
                  the FEP computations. },

                  described for calculations of the potential of mean
                  force (PMF) in multidimensions on massively
                  distributed supercomputers. The approach involves
                  coupling thousands of umbrella sampling (US)
                  simulation windows distributed to cover the space of
                  order parameters with a Hamiltonian molecular
                  dynamics replica exchange (H-REMD) algorithm to
                  enhance the sampling of each simulation. In the
                  present application, US/H-REMD is carried out in a
                  two-dimensional (2D) space and exchanges are
                  attempted alternatively along the two axes
                  corresponding to the two order parameters. The
                  US/H-REMD strategy is implemented on the basis of
                  parallel/parallel multiple copy protocol at the MPI
                  level, and therefore can fully exploit computing
                  power of large-scale supercomputers. Here the novel
                  technique is illustrated using the leadership
                  supercomputer IBM Blue Gene/P with an application to
                  a typical biomolecular calculation of general
                  interest, namely the binding of calcium ions to the
                  small protein Calbindin D9k. The free energy
                  landscape associated with two order parameters, the
                  distance between the ion and its binding pocket and
                  the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of the binding
                  pocket relative the crystal structure, was
                  calculated using the US/H-REMD method. The results
                  are then used to estimate the absolute binding free
                  energy of calcium ion to Calbindin D9k. The tests
                  demonstrate that the 2D US/H-REMD scheme greatly
                  accelerates the configurational sampling of the
                  binding pocket, thereby improving the convergence of
                  the potential of mean force calculation.  }

                  molecular systems in chemistry and biophysics has
                  generated much interest in discovering new ways to
                  enhance the phase space mixing of these protocols in
                  order to improve sampling of uncorrelated
                  configurations. Here, we demonstrate how both of
                  these classes of algorithms can be considered as
                  special cases of Gibbs sampling within a Markov
                  chain Monte Carlo framework. Gibbs sampling is a
                  well-studied scheme in the field of statistical
                  inference in which different random variables are
                  alternately updated from conditional
                  distributions. While the update of the
                  conformational degrees of freedom by Metropolis
                  Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics unavoidably
                  generates corre- lated samples, we show how
                  judicious updating of the thermodynamic state
                  indices-corresponding to thermodynamic parameters
                  such as temperature or alchemical coupling
                  variables-can substantially increase mixing while
                  still sampling from the desired distributions. We
                  show how state update methods in common use can lead
                  to suboptimal mixing, and present some simple,
                  inexpensive alternatives that can increase mixing
                  of the overall Markov chain, reducing simulation
                  times necessary to obtain estimates of the desired
                  precision. These improved schemes are demonstrated
                  for several common applications, including an
                  alchemical expanded ensemble simulation, parallel
                  tempering, and multidimensional replica exchange

 Abstract =     {The growing adoption of generalized-ensemble
                  algorithms for biomolecular simulation has resulted
                  in a resurgence in the use of the weighted histogram
                  analysis method (WHAM) to make use of all data
                  generated by these simulations. Unfortunately, the
                  original presentation of WHAM by Kumar et al. is not
                  directly applicable to data generated by these
                  methods. WHAM was originally formulated to combine
                  data from independent samplings of the canonical
                  ensemble, whereas many generalized-ensemble
                  algorithms sample from mixtures of canonical
                  ensembles at different temperatures. Sorting
                  configurations generated from a parallel tempering
                  simulation by temperature obscures the temporal
                  correlation in the data and results in an improper
                  treatment of the statistical uncertainties used in
                  constructing the estimate of the density of
                  states. Here we present variants of WHAM, STWHAM and
                  PTWHAM, derived with the same set of assumptions,
                  that can be directly applied to several generalized
                  ensemble algorithms, including simulated tempering,
                  parallel tempering (better known as replica-exchange
                  among temperatures), and replica-exchange simulated
                  tempering. We present methods that explicitly
                  capture the considerable temporal correlation in
                  sequentially generated configurations using
                  autocorrelation analysis. This allows estimation of
                  the statistical uncertainty in WHAM estimates of
                  expectations for the canonical ensemble. We test the
                  method with a one-dimensional model system and then
                  apply it to the estimation of potentials of mean
                  force from parallel tempering simulations of the
                  alanine dipeptide in both implicit and explicit
                  solvent.},
