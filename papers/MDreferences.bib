  annote =       {The widespread popularity of replica exchange and
                  expanded ensemble algorithms for simulating complex
                  molecular systems in chemistry and biophysics has
                  generated much interest in discovering new ways to
                  enhance the phase space mixing of these protocols in
                  order to improve sampling of uncorrelated
                  configurations. Here, we demonstrate how both of
                  these classes of algorithms can be considered as
                  special cases of Gibbs sampling within a Markov
                  chain Monte Carlo framework. Gibbs sampling is a
                  well-studied scheme in the field of statistical
                  inference in which different random variables are
                  alternately updated from conditional
                  distributions. While the update of the
                  conformational degrees of freedom by Metropolis
                  Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics unavoidably
                  generates corre- lated samples, we show how
                  judicious updating of the thermodynamic state
                  indices-corresponding to thermodynamic parameters
                  such as temperature or alchemical coupling
                  variables-can substantially increase mixing while
                  still sampling from the desired distributions. We
                  show how state update methods in common use can lead
                  to suboptimal mixing, and present some simple,
                  inexpensive alternatives that can increase mixing
                  of the overall Markov chain, reducing simulation
                  times necessary to obtain estimates of the desired
                  precision. These improved schemes are demonstrated
                  for several common applications, including an
                  alchemical expanded ensemble simulation, parallel
                  tempering, and multidimensional replica exchange
                  umbrella sampling.  }

 Abstract =     {The growing adoption of generalized-ensemble
                  algorithms for biomolecular simulation has resulted
                  in a resurgence in the use of the weighted histogram
                  analysis method (WHAM) to make use of all data
                  generated by these simulations. Unfortunately, the
                  original presentation of WHAM by Kumar et al. is not
                  directly applicable to data generated by these
                  methods. WHAM was originally formulated to combine
                  data from independent samplings of the canonical
                  ensemble, whereas many generalized-ensemble
                  algorithms sample from mixtures of canonical
                  ensembles at different temperatures. Sorting
                  configurations generated from a parallel tempering
                  simulation by temperature obscures the temporal
                  correlation in the data and results in an improper
                  treatment of the statistical uncertainties used in
                  constructing the estimate of the density of
                  states. Here we present variants of WHAM, STWHAM and
                  PTWHAM, derived with the same set of assumptions,
                  that can be directly applied to several generalized
                  ensemble algorithms, including simulated tempering,
                  parallel tempering (better known as replica-exchange
                  among temperatures), and replica-exchange simulated
                  tempering. We present methods that explicitly
                  capture the considerable temporal correlation in
                  sequentially generated configurations using
                  autocorrelation analysis. This allows estimation of
                  the statistical uncertainty in WHAM estimates of
                  expectations for the canonical ensemble. We test the
                  method with a one-dimensional model system and then
                  apply it to the estimation of potentials of mean
                  force from parallel tempering simulations of the
                  alanine dipeptide in both implicit and explicit
                  solvent.},
